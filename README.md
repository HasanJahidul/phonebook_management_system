# phonebook_management_system

###Develop a phonebook management application.
It should contain the following features:
* for every person you should keep him/her name, address, email, and phone number (a person
can have multiple phone numbers)
* adding functionality which add a new person in the phonebook.
* Updating functionality which will update or edit any existing person in the phonebook.
* Deleting functionality which will delete any existing person from the phonebook.
* Display functionality which will display all the entries from the phonebook.
* Searching functionality which will be used for searching a particular person’s information from
the phonebook if exits otherwise display “not found” and asked for adding a new entry.
* Finally, it should have a store functionality to store all the entries in the phonebook into a text
file if user wants for maintaining a physical copy in the hard drive.
As this application would be a console based, so first display a menu containing all the available options
of the application, and then user will decide what he wants to do. User can exit from the application
when he pressed “quit”.
